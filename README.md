# Basic Web Server and Web Client
This project was made for the course **ENE4019 Computer Networks** at Hanyang University

The project consits of creating a basic web server with corresponding web client. The server were supposed to be able to handle GET requests of type *text/html* and *image/jpg*. However we were encuraged to implement other requests as well. So the web server can handle GET, HEAD and POST request from the client (which of course is able to send thouse requests).
